# Hangman
Classic Hangman game.
This game had been written as inspired by Tech With Tim's video series:

by following his concepts, but adjusted to my taste and needs.
Whenever possible, certain parts have been written as I wanted,
certain parts modified and certain parts added on to. Also, I have finished
the game and corrected some potential bugs / non-conformities.
Also, instead of only playing with mouse clicks, you can play the game with keyboard.
